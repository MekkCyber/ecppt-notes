# Module 3 - Enumeration

https://cdn.members.elearnsecurity.com/ptp_v5/section_2/module_3/html/index.html

__________________________
## 3.1. Introduction
The goal of enumeration is to gather more detailed information on both devices and resources attached to the network. This includes account names, shares, misconfigured services and so on. Like the scanning phase, enumeration involves active connections to the remote devices in the network.

There are may protocols on networked systems that none can easily exploit if administrators do not take the necessary steps to either secure protocols or disable them.

For example, NetBIOS (Network Basic Input Output Systems) is the service that allows Windows systems to share files, folders, and printers among machines on a LAN. If not properly configured, it can lead to large amount of information leakage.

NetBIOS can be extremely useful in determining types of system information such as user IDs and open shares.

In addition to NetBIOS, a protocol that we will explore in this module is SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol). It is a protocol used to both gather information and configure network devices (printers, switches, servers)

## 3.2. NetBIOS
#### 3.2.1. What is NetBIOS
**History**
  The very first version of NetBIOS was developed late in 1983. It was designed as an API (not as a protocol as many suspect) that served its purpose in developing client/server applications.

  Since this old version was not intended to be encapsulated within TCP and UDP packets, in 1987 a new version was released: NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT or NBT).

  This new version of NetBIOS, developed to work where the TCP/IP protocol suite is available, is considered a true protocol and it is described in the following two RFCs: [1001](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1001) and [1002](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1002)

**Purpose**
  The main purpose of NetBIOS is to allow applications on different systems to communicate with one another over the LAN. It is used for a multitude of purposes including: sharing printer and files, remote procedure calls, exchange messages and much more.
  As expected, these features may reveal additional information such as computer names, user names, domains, printers, available shares, and much more.

#### 3.2.2. How NetBIOS Works
PC's on a NetBIOS LAN communicate either by establishing a session (TCP) or by using datagrams (UDP). To do this, [NetBIOS](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb962072.aspx) uses the following TCP and UDP ports (see the illustration):
- UDP 137 for name services
- UDP 138 for datagram services
- TCP 139 for session services

1. Name services
  The name service has the same purpose of a DNS record, it translates and maps a NetBIOS name to an IP address.

  A name is an unique 16-byte address that identifies a NetBIOS resource on the network and is dynamically registered when either services or applications start. Names can be registered as unique names or as group names.

  You can find more information about NetBIOS name resolution [here][https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc738412(v=ws.10).aspx].

  In order to locate a resource, a NetBIOS Name Query is used to resolve the NetBIOS name to an IP address. A name is composed of 16 characters: the firsts 15 characters can be specified by the user, while the 16th character is used to indicate the resource type and goes from 00 to FF (Hex).

  Name types available: [More](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc224454.aspx)
  
    ```
    |       Name      |       Service/Type      |
    |-----------------|-------------------------|
    
    |[computer_name]00|Workstation Service      |
    
    |[computer_name]03|Messenger Service        |
    
    |[computer_name]06|RAS Server Service       |
    
    |[computer_name]1F|NetDDE Service           |
    
    |[computer_name]20|Server Service           |
    
    |[computer_name]21|RAS Client Service       |
    
    |[computer_name]BE|Network Monitor Agent    |
    
    |[computer_name]BF|Network Monitor App.     |
    
    |[user_name]03    |Messegner Service        |
    
    |[domain_name]1D  |Master Browser           |
    
    |[domain_name]1B  |Domain Master Browser    |
    
    |[domain_name]00  |Domain Name              |
    
    |[domain_name]1C  |Domain Control           |
    
    |[domain_name]1E  |Browser Service Elections|
    
    |__MSBROWSE__     |Master Browser           |
    ```
    
  You can run the following command to show the NetBIOS names on our machine:
  ```
  nbtstat -n
  ```

  **The service that actually maps NetBIOS names to IP address is called Windows Internet Name Service (WINS).**
    If you want to dig deeper into WINS, here are some valid Microsoft resources:
    - [WINS Overview][https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc725802.aspx]
    - [What is WINS][https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc784180(v=ws.10).aspx]
    - [WINS defined][https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc784707(v=ws.10).aspx]

2. Datagram services
  NetBIOS Datagram Service (NBDS) permits the sending of messages to a NetBIOS name. It runs on UDP port 138, therefore making it a connectionless communication.

  The datagram services allows the sending and receiving of the datagram messages to and from:
  - a specific NetBIOS name
  - broadcast the datagram to all NetBIOS names

  The datagram and broadcast methods allow one computer to communicate with several other computers at the same time however, these communications are limited in terms of message size. There is no error detection / correction using the datagram or broadcast method, however, datagram communication allows communications without the need for a session to be established.

3. Session services
  NetBIOS Session Service (NBSS) is the most commonly known of the NetBIOS services. It allows two names to establish connection in order to exchange data.

  For example, when a device creates a file sharing connection the session service is used. Once the session has been established, the two workstations use the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, which we will explore later on.

  The following steps are used to establish the connection:
  1. The NetBIOS name is resolved into an IP address
  2. A TCP connection is established between the 2 devices, using TCP port 139
  3. The device starting the connection sends a NetBIOS Session Request over t he TCP connection
      1. This includes the NetBIOS name of the application that wants to establish the connection and the NetBIOS name to which to connect
  4. If the remote device is listening on that name, there will be a positive response and the response and the session will be established.

#### 3.2.3. SMB (Server Message Block)
Before seeing how to use NetBIOS, there is another popular protocol that we have to understand: Server Message Block. SMB lets you share files, disks, directories, printers, and in some cases, even COM ports across a network.

Before Windows 2000, SMB ran only with NetBIOS over TCP/IP (port 139), therefore a NetBIOS was required.

Windows 2000 and higher allow us to run [SMB directly over TCP/IP](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/204279) (direct hosting), without the need to run over NetBIOS sessions. To do this, the TCP port 445 is used.

Since SMB provides several features such as manipulating files, sharing, messaging, Inter-process Communication (IPC) and more, it is one of the most attractive service to explore during our enumeration phase.

#### 3.2.4. NetBIOS Commands and Tools
We will explore different commands and tools that can be used to enumerate system information using NetBIOS. The one we will use the most is the famous `nbstat`.

By using the data we gathered in the scanning phase, we can search for systems with ports 137/139/145 open.
###### 3.2.4.1 Nbstat
  [Nbstat](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc940106.aspx) is a tool developed to troubleshoot NetBIOS name resolution problems. The main options it offers are as follows:
  - `-a` (adapter status) : Lists the remote machine's name table given its name
  - `-A` (Adapter status) : List the remote machine's name table given its IP
  - `-c` (cache) : List NBT's cache of remote [machine] names and their IP addresses
  - `-n` (names) : List local NetBIOS names
  - `-r` (resolved) : Lists names resolved by broadcast via WINS
  - `-R` (Reload)   : Purges and reloads the remote cache name table
  - `-S` (Sessions) : Lists sessions table with the destination IP addresses
  - `-s` (session)  : Lists sessions table converting destination IP addresses to computer NetBIOS names
  - `-RR` (ReleaseRefresh) : Sends Name Release packets to WINS and starts Refresh

  Example:
    Let's suppose that, during our scanning phase, we came across a machine (192.168.99.162) that has the following open ports:
    ```
    Starting Nmap 6.49BETA5 ( https://nmap.org ) EST
    Nmap scan report for 192.168.99.162
    Host is up (0.085s latency).
    Not shown: 1990 closed ports
    PORT      STATE   SERVICE
    135/tcp   open    msrpc
    139/tcp   open    netbios-ssn
    445/tcp   open    microsoft-ds
    123/udp   open    ntp
    137/udp   open    netbios-ns
    ```

    Using this machine as target of our test, we can open a Windows terminal and use `nbstat -A` to start gathering information about it. Notice that on Windows systems, `nbstat` is already installed.

    The command will look like the following (see image):
    ```
    C:\>nbstat -A <target_IP_Address>

    Local Area Connection 2:
    Node IpAddressL [192.168.99.100] Score Id: []

        NetBIOS Remote Machine Name Table

        Name               Type       Status
    ---------------------------------------------    
    ELS-WINXP      <20>   UNIQUE    Registered
    WORKGROUP      <20>   GROUP     Registered
    ELS-WINXP      <20>   UNIQUE    Registered
    WORKGROUP      <1E>   GROUP     Registered
    WORKGROUP      <1D>   UNIQUE    Registered
    ..__MSBROWSE__.<01>   GROUP     Registered

    MAC Address = 00-50-56-B1-94-80
    ```

    From here we can see that the computer name is *ELS-WINXP* and that the domain name is *WORKGROUP*.
    The `20` in `ELS-WINXP <20> UNIQUE Registered` refers to a server service (from the table earlier (approx. line 49)). This means that the host has file and printer shares enabled, therefore we may be able to access them.


###### 3.2.4.2. Nbtscan
  In Linux, there are other tools that allows us to obtain similar information. One of the most popular is `nbtscan`. The most basic command to run is the following:
  ```
  nbtscan -v [target_IP_Address]
  ```
  or for several network:
  ```
  nbtscan -v [target_IP_Address]/[subnetmask]
  ```

  The tools we have seen up to this point operate using the NetBIOS Naming Service (NBNS).

###### 3.2.4.3. Net command
  With this information we can now move on  and verify what the target machine is sharing over the network. To do so we can use the Microsoft [net][https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490949.aspx] command. The `net` command offers many features such as the ability to update user accounts, display, view, and modify services, connect computers to shared resources and much more.

  For our purposes, we will only focus on the [net view][https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh875576.aspx] command.

  `Net view` allows us to list domain, computers, and resources shared by a computer in the network. Let us see how to use it against our previous target.
  The command we are going to run is the following:
    ```
    C:\>net view 192.168.99.162
    Shared resources at 192.168.99.162

    Share name    Type   Used as    Comment
    ---------------------------------------------------
    C             Disk
    Frank         Disk
    FrankDocs     Disk
    My Documents  Disk
    WorkSharing   Disk

    The command completed successfully.
    ```

  To explore these shares we can simply browse them by utilizing the [net use](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490717.aspx) command.

  The `net use` command can be used to connect or disconnect a computer from a shared resource. This means that we can connect our computer to the remote shred folder in order to navigate the remote folders.

  For example, if we want to start a connection on the C resource, we can use the following command:
  ```
  net use K: \\192.168.99.162\C
  ```

  The command will add the `K:` drive to our mapped drives, thus containing the files and folders from the victim `C` resource. We can now explore these files or attach other shares to see if the machine exposed useful information.

###### 3.2.4.4. Smbclient and mount
  If you are using a Linux machine, the same results can be obtained with different tools. If we want to list all the shares of a specific computer we can use `smbclient` as follows:
  ```
  $ sudo smbclient -L 192.168.99.162
  Enter root's password:
  Domain=[ELS-WINXP] OS=[Windows 5.1] Server=[Windows 2000 LAN Manager]

        Sharename       Type     Comment
        ---------       ----     -------
        My Documents    Disk
        IPC$            IPC      Remote IPC
        Frank           Disk
        C               Disk
        WorkSharing     Disk
        FrankDocs       Disk
        ADMIN$          Disk     Remote Admin
        C$              Disk     Default Share
  Domain=[ELS-WINXP] OS=[Windows 5.1] Server=[Windows 2000 LAN Manager]
  ```

  As you can see, `smbclient` also displays a few other hidden shares such as `IPC$`, `C$` and `ADMIN$`. You can identify hidden shares since they have a `$` sign at the end.

  The three shares listed above are the default administrative shared and have their own specific purpose. For example `IPC$` is used for *Inter-process communications* and can be used to leverage *null* session attacks.

  If we wish to navigate the target shares, we can use mount as an alternative to `net use`. For example, if we want to navigate the C share, we will run something similar to the following command.
  ```
  sudo mount.cifs //192.168.99.162/C /media/K_share/ user=,pass=
  sudo smbclient \\\\192.168.99.162\\<SHARE> 
  ```

  After we run it, we will be able t o browse the remote share (see image - shows we can `ls` into it).

#### 3.2.5. Null Session
We have seen this far some examples of basic NetBIOS information that we can gather from Windows and Linux OS.

Now we will move on to other tools and commands that can also provide a great deal of additional information. We will also query the NetBIOS API and exploit null sessions.

Null sessions are one of the oldest and most known attacks performed on Windows 2000 and Windows NT environments. Thanks to this weakness, malicious users are able to establish a connection to the victim in order to gather information such as shares, users, groups, registry keys, and much more.

Null session rely on Common Internet File System (CIFS) and Server Message Block (SMB) API, that return information even to an unauthenticated user.

In other words, a malicious user can establish a connection to a Windows system without providing any username or password. In order for the attack to work, the connection must be established to the administrative share named IPC (Inter Process Communication).

The easiest way to test if a machine is vulnerable to null session is running the `net` command. Note that in contrast to the connection we established in the previous slides, we are going to target the `IPC$` share instead:
  ```
  C:\> net use \\192.168.99.162\IPC$ "" /u:""
  The command completed successfully.
  ```

  Description:
  - `IPC$` : is the hidden share that we are trying to connect to
  - `192.168.99.168` : IP address
  - `""` : null password
  - `/u:""` : empty (anonymous) username

As we can see in the screenshot, the command works. From this moment on, we have an active connection to our victim. Then, we can gather the information from it.

There are some tools that are specifically designed to exploit null session. With these tools we will be able to automatically gather a great deal of information from the remote machine.

Notice hat some of these tools are very old and OS dependent, therefore, we will use both Windows or Linux.

###### 3.2.5.1. Winfingerprint
  Wingerprint is an administrative network resource scanner that allows us to scan machines in our LAN in order to gather details about each host. This includes NetBIOS shares, disk information, services, users, groups, and more.

  By selecting the boxes in its GUI, we are able to enumerate information such as user SID, password policy, users, shares, and much more.

###### 3.2.5.2. Winfo
  Winfo is another simple enumeration tool for NetBIOS as it displays all the information through null sessions. In contrast with the previous tool, it does not offer a graphical interface. Instead, we will have to run it from our command prompt.

  The command to execute it is very simple:
  ```
  winfo <taget_IP_Address> -n
  ```

  Where `-n` tells the tools to establish a null session before trying to dump the information.

  The following snippet shows the `winfo` results:
  ```
  Null session established.
  USER ACCOUNTS:
  * Administrator
    (This account is the built-in administrator account)
  * eLS
  * Frank
  * Guest
    (This account is the built-in gurst account)
  * netadmin
  * SUPPORT_388945a0
  SHARES:
  * My Documents
  * IPC$
  * Frank
  ...
  ```

###### 3.2.5.3. DumpSec (Windows)
DumpSec is an auditing tool that is able to gather file system information, registry, shares, users, groups, and much more. It can be used both via GUI or CLI.

Steps:
1. Click `Report` -> `Select Computer` -> Insert Target IP
2. Click `Report` -> `Dump Users as column`
3. After everything is set, click `OK`

As you can imagine, depending upon the selected report you can gather a large a mount of valuable information from the remote system. Moreover, the tool allows us to both search and export the result for later inspection.

Be sure to gather all the information you think may be useful for later phases of the penetration test.

###### 3.2.5.4. Enum4linux (Linux)
[Enum4linux][https://labs.portcullis.co.uk/tools/enum4linux/] is a wrapper around *rpcclient*, *net*, *nmblookup* and *smbclient*.

As you will see, enum4linux is both very easy to use and returns a great deal of valuable information. We can run it with the following command (for output see image):
```
enum4linux <targetIPAddress>
```

Enum4linux will gather and organize the information in the following way:
- Target information
- Workgroup/Domain
- Domain SID
- OS Information
- Users
- Share Enumeration
- Password Policy
- Groups
- Users SID
- Printer Info

###### 3.2.5.5. Rpcclient (Linux)
[rpcclient][https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/manpages/rpcclient.1.html] is a tool that can execute Microsoft RPC (Remote Procedure Call) functionalities. As we will see in the future slides, it offers a multitude of command that we can run on a remote machine.

In order to use it however, we must first establish a connection to the remote machine with the following command:
  ```
  rpcclient -N -U "" <targetIPAddress>
  ```

  where:
  - `-N` instructs the rpcclient not to ask a password
  - `-U` "" sets the network username (none in this case)

  You can list all the available commands with the `help` command.
    There is a very long list of commands. For example, we can retrieve users available on the machine using the following command:
    ```
    rpcclient $> enumdomusers
    user:[Administrator] rid:[0x1f4]
    user:[eLS] rid:[0x3eb]
    user:[Frank] rid:[0x3ed]
    user:[Guest] rid:[0x1f5]
    user:[HelpAssistant] rid:[0x3e8]
    user:[netadmin] rid:[0x3ec]
    user:[SUPPORT_388945a0] rid:[0x3ea]
    rpcclient $>
    ```
  It also have an autocomplete feature by tapping `tab` twice.

Small list of useful commands:
- `numalsgroups`
- `srvinfo`
- `lookupnames`
- `queryuser`
- `enumprivs`

__________________________
## 3.3. SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)
SNMP is used for exchanging management information between network devices.
For example, SNMP may be used to configure a router or simply check its status.

#### 3.3.1. What and Where it is used
In the SNMP protocol there is a manager and a number of agents. The agents either wait for commands from the manager or send critical messages (trap) to the manager. The manager is usually a system administrator.

There are 4 types of SNMP commands used to control and monitor managed devices:
  - Read : used to monitor devices
  - Write : used to configure devices and change device settings
  - Trap : used to *trap* events from the device and report them back to the monitoring system (asynchronously, without especially being asked by the NMS)
  - Traversal Operations : used to determine what variables a certain device supports

There are multiple versions of SNMP:
  - *SNMPv1* is both the original and most vulnerable (cleartext protocol)
  - *SNMPv2* is just as likely to be compromised given its inherent weaknesses
  - *SNMPv3* is the newest version and, although it uses encryption, it is still susceptible to attacks like brute forcing

#### 3.3.2. How It Works (Agents, NMS, MIB, ...)
SNMP receives general messages on UDP port 161 and trap messages on UDP 162. SNMP works on the basis that network management systems send out request and the managed devices (agents) return a response. This is implemented using one of four operations (similar to HTTP verbs) `Get`, `GetNext`, `Set`, and `Trap`.

SNMP messages consists of a header and a PDU (Protocol Data Units). The header consists of the SNMP version number and the **community string**, **which is used as a form of "secure" password authentication in SNMP**.

It is important to know that there are 2 types of community names of strings:
- Private community strings : allow access to *write* rights
- Public community string : allows *read* access rights on the system

The PDU depends on the type of message that is being sent.
  The `Get`, `GetNext`,and `Set`, as well as the PDU responses, consists of:
  - PDU type
  - Request ID
  - Error status
  - Error Index
  - Other Object/variable fields

  The `Trap` contains files like:
  - Enterprise
  - Agent
  - Agent address
  - Generic trap type
  - Specific trap code
  - Timestamp
  - Object/value

[MIB](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E13161_01/tuxedo/docs10gr3/snmpmref/1tmib.html#wp1032892)**s (Management Information Base) is a collection of definitions which define the properties of the managed object on the device (such as router, switch, etc.).**

  In other words, it is a database of information that is relevant to the network manager.

In order to keep items well organized, the database is structure as a tree, thus, each object of this tree has a number and a name.

  The complete path, from the top of the tree, down to the point of interest, forms the name of that point called OID (Object IDentifier)

  Nodes near the to of the tree are extremely general in nature.

  You will find that all of the OID's will start with `1.3.6.1`. Each leaf in the tree is a property of the device that can be read/written by the manager.

  A query will have to specify the OID address such as `1.3.6.1.4.1.140.305` (beaDomainList) (see illustration for the tree)

  As one moves further down, the names become more and more specific. Once near the bottom, each node represents a particular feature on a specific device (or **agent**).

#### 3.3.3. SNMP Attacks
The following is a brief list of attacks that one can run against SNMP, which we will inspect in detail in the future:
- Flooding <br>
  DOS attack which involves spoofing an SNMP agent and flooding the SNMP trap management with tens of thousands of SNMP traps, varying in size from 50 bytes to 32 kilobytes, until the SNMP management is unable to function properly.
- Community <br>
  Using Default community string to gain privileged access to systems
- Brute Force <br>
  Using a tool to guess the community strings used on a system to achieve elevated privileges

Enumeration of SNMP information happens by utilizing tools and methods to list the information available within the system. The type and amount of information will depend on the community string obtained, therefore, **the first skill to master is how to obtain community strings**.

  1. Obtain a community string by sniffing the network traffic
    Since SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 utilize clear text communications, it is easy to sniff the passwords coming from the network management systems.

  2. Obtain a community string by using a dictionary attack
    As you can imagine, having a good dictionary is key when performing this type of attack. Beware though, most current Network Intrusion Detection Systems will alert to this activity as it sees the multiple login attempts with different strings.

Once we acquire the string, we can move on to other tools in order to extract information from the remote device. Notice that *read* access is enough to extract a wealth of information (useful for later attacks).

Now that we know the steps to perform, let us see what tools we can use:
#### 3.3.3.1. snmpwalk
[snmpwalk][http://www.net-snmp.org/docs/man/snmpwalk.html] (part of the [Net-SNMP][http://www.net-snmp.org/] suite) uses `SNMP GETNEXT` request to query a network entity for a tree of information.

Since an object identifier (OID) may be given on the command line, knowing the OID of the target device may be very useful.

This OID specifies which portion of the object identifier space will be searched using `GETNEXT` request.

All variables in the subtree below the given OID are queried and their values presented to the user. If no OID is present, snmpwalk will search the subtree rooted at `SNMPv2-SMI::mib-2` (including any MIB object values from other MIB modules that are defined as lying within this subtree).

If the network entity has an error processing the request packet, an error packet will be returned. A message will then be shown, helping to pinpoint the request was malformed.

If the tree search attempts to search beyond the end of the MIB, the message "End of MIB" will be displayed.

In basic scenario, snmpwalk takes as single IOD, and displays a list of all the results. These resided within the subtree rooted on this OID.

We will show a snippet of output. Notice that, since the tool outputs a wealth of information, we may want to pipe the requests to files for later inspections.

  SNMPv2-MIB::sysLocation.0 = STRING:
  ```
  The `-v` option specifies the SNMP version to use (`2c`), while `-c` stse the community string to use (`public`).

  If the output returns the OID numerically, as the following example:
    ```
    iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0 = STRING: "Hardware: INtel64 Family ..."
    ```
  Please be sure to install the `snmp-mibs-downloader` package. Once installed, comment the fourth line in the following file `/etc/snmp/snmp.conf`

snmpwalk can also be used with either a single MIB object, or even an exact OID instance (returning the corresponding value), as follows:
  ```
  snmpwalk -c public -vl 192.168.102.149 hrSWInstalledName
  ```

Conversely, it is also possible to start the walk at a higher level, retrieving more than one group of information. This would typically retrieve all the information known to an agent.

snmpwalk is very useful in gaining information form a system but, as stated earlier, one must minimally understand how SNMP work. Checking the manual is strongly suggested, since it offers both useful and customizable options.


#### 3.3.3.2. snmpset
[snmpset][http://www.net-snmp.org/docs/man/snmpset.html] (part of the Net-SNMP suite) is an SNMP application that uses `SNMP SET` requests to either set or change information on a network entity.

In other words, the `SET` operation allows either the management application or the manager, to set the value of an attribute (of a managed object) in the agent.

Please note that one or more OIDs must be given as arguments on the command line.
In addition to the OID, a `type` (string, integer, etc.) and a `value` must also be provided.

Before actually setting the new value for a specific object, let's first check its actual value with *snmpwalk*. In out example we will target the `sysContact` OID:
  ```
  snmpwalk -v 2c -c public 192.168.102.149 system.sysContact.0
  SNMPv2-MIB::sysContact.0 = STRING: admin@els.com
  ```
  As we can see, at the moment, the value is set to `admin@els.com` and the type is `STRING`.

Let us now try to both change its value with the following snmpset command and then print its value to verify the changes.
  ```
  snmpset -v 2c -c public 192.168.102.149 system.sysContact.0 s new@els.com
  SNMPv2-MIB::sysContact.0 = STRING: new@els.com
  ```
  Above, `s` tells the snmpset that we want to use a `STRING` type, while `new@els.com` is the new value for the entity.

Let us run the snmpwalk once again and see what we get:
  ```
  snmpwalk -v 2c -c public 192.168.102.149 system.sysContact.0
  SNMPv2-MIB::sysContact.0 = STRING: new@els.com
  ```

  Notice that in snmpset the `-v` and `-c` options are used in the same way as snmpwalk. The only difference really is that we have two new arguments: one for the type (`s`) and one for the value we are going to get (`new@els.com`).


#### 3.3.3.3. Nmap SNMP script
Nmap comes with some basic scripts: `snmp-brute`, `snmp-interfaces`, `snmp-netstat`, `snmp-processes`, `snmp-sysdescr`, `snmp-win32-services`, `snmp-info`, and more.

You can list them by navigating into the Nmap script folder and then running the following command:
```
stduser@els:/usr/share/nmap/scripts& ls -l | grep -i snmp
```

Depending on the script you wish to run, you may have to set different options. Most of these can be executed with the following syntax as long as you are running as root:
```
nmap -sU -p 161 --script=<script_name> <IP_adress>
```
